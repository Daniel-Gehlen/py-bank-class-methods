**Report on Implementation of Banking System using Classes**

**Introduction:**
The purpose of this report is to present the implementation of a banking system using classes in Python. The system is designed to manage customer information, bank accounts, and perform operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and display of statements. The implementation was carried out based on a specific case study, where the `User` and `Account` classes were developed, following the UML class model.

**Methods:**
- **`User` Class:** Represents a user of the banking system. It has attributes such as name, date of birth, CPF, and address. The methods of the class include creating a new user and filtering users by CPF.

- **`Account` Class:** Represents a bank account associated with a user. It has attributes such as agency, account number, balance, limit, statement, and number of withdrawals. The methods of the class include deposit, withdrawal, display of statement, and creation of a new account.

- **Auxiliary Functions:** Functions such as `menu()` were implemented to display the menu of operations, `create_user()` to create a new user, `filter_user()` to filter users by CPF, `create_account()` to create a new account, and `list_accounts()` to list all created accounts.

**Results:**
The implementation of the banking system using classes was successful. The system allows creating new users, creating bank accounts associated with these users, performing deposit and withdrawal operations, displaying the account statement, and listing all created accounts.

**Conclusion:**
The use of classes provided more efficient organization and structuring of the code, allowing better modularization and code reuse. In addition, the use of classes facilitates the maintenance and scalability of the system, making it more flexible for future updates and additions of functionalities.

**Case Study:**
Imagine a financial institution that wants to automate its processes of managing accounts and customers. With the implementation of this banking system using classes, the institution will be able to offer its customers a more efficient and personalized experience. Customers will be able to easily open new accounts, perform banking operations such as deposits and withdrawals, and track their transactions through the account statement. In addition, the institution will have a more robust and scalable system, capable of handling a large volume of customers and transactions. This will result in an improvement in the quality of services provided and customer satisfaction.
